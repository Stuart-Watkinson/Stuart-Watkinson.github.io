								<p>Cheffin' it up was developed during my studies at University of
									Staffordshire. The project was my first venture into using the Unity Engine,
									featuring a crafting system and points system that is saved locally and compared to
									10 of your other top scores.</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							The goal of this project was to create a 2D Top-Down game with multiplicative mechanics,
							providing a full gameplay experience. I really wanted to focus on the mechanics of this
							project,
							and ensure they are not only robust but fun to play.
							This want led to me taking inspiration from vampire survivors,
							as the horde survivor genre of games creates opportunity for a playground where
							players can freely interact with the mechanics.
							<br><br>
							The focus of the games development went into the<b><i> crafting system</b></i>, <b><i>
									shooting</b></i> and <b><i>high score save system</b></i>.
							Each of these forced me to problem solve outside of what I already knew,
							and to not only complete the project but also to create a product I was happy with. As this was a
							solo project, I had the responsbility for all the games coding and design, art and assets
							belong to their respective creators.

						<h2>Crafting, Items and Inventory</h2>

							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							All three of these systems are built around Unity’s <b>Scriptable Objects</b> system.
							Scriptable
							objects are useful in reducing a projects memory usage, by avoiding the need to create many
							copies of the same values, it allows for a singular copy in the memory that is used as a
							<b>reference</b>
							for the stored values.
							<br><br>
							Due to the nature of creating a ‘horde-style’ game with constant item instantiations,
							<b>performance was a key factor to consider</b> and I wanted to use my project development as
							a
							means to better understand the unity engine with all roads pointing to the use of Scriptable
							Objects.
							<br><br>
							The crafting system itself uses the objects ‘name’ variable to run a string search against
							an established cooking recipe list. These recipes are written as such, “WheatMeatCheese”
							with each being changed to match the given recipe. This system could be improved by
							allowing flexibility in the crafting process, rather than having to place items into
							specific slots,
							which is something I hope to rectify in the future. The method used was picked as it
							matched with the already established systems along side the use of scriptable
							objects.
							<br><br>
							The inventory system allowed me to interact with Unity’s interface systems;
							IDragHandler & IBegin(/End)DragHandler. These interfaces define functionality within a
							Unity Project, with the three I mentioned being pre-built interfaces that define drag & drop
							functionality. This isn't a simple copy and paste job however, these interfaces just
							provide tools to simplfy the creation of systems, and in using these tools I included features such as a dynamic
							inventory in which players can swap items.

						<h2>Shooting</h2>
						<p>
							Early in development, players used arrow keys to fire weapons meaning that players could only fire in up to 8 directions which wasn’t ideal for a game where threats
							can approach you from any given direction. I instead made the decision to implement mouse
							shooting, as it better suited the <b>overall design and game feel</b>.
							<br><br>
							When talking to peers and lecturers, I concluded that it wasn’t a simple
							transition to change to mouse shooting. I needed to understand a certain level of vector maths and after
							a lot of research and <i>a lot</i> of trial and error, I realised that I had
							taken the wrong approach when applying what I learnt as I couldn’t simply add it onto what I had
							already created but I needed to create something new.
							<br><br>
							This led to a much smoother development with the end result having  a few hiccups that I
							cleaned up throughout the project. I had been treating the player as the firing point,
							however what was needed was a disembodied component that rotated around the player,
							almost acting as an invisible gun for the projectiles to be fired from.

							To provide a true gameplay loop, I wanted to add more player incentive outside of just
							playing the game. This started as a simple scoring system, with the player achieving points for
							certain actions including; crafting, survival time, and monsters killed, which would then
							be totalled throughout the playtime before being displayed on the final screen. This was an
							incredibly simple addition that I added early on, but as the games development was coming to
							an end, I came to realise I should try to do more with this system.
							<br><br>
							After talking to lecturers about how I could add to this system, I was given multiple
							options of how to approach a system such as score keeping. The use of a database was too
							complex within the time frame I had left on the project, however the use of writing to file
							was exactly what I was looking for. This is a common approach to game state saving afterall.
							The Unity Engine has an implementation of <b>JSON <i>(JavaScript Object Notation)</i></b>,
							making it
							easy to seralize/deseralize data to store game states locally on a players PC.
							<br><br>
							What this really means is a <b>conversion of C# objects/structures into JSON
								format</b>,
							and vice versa. Having such a short time frame to research and implement JsonUtility into
							the game, I was lucky to find that JSON is built to be easy for humans to read/write, and
							simple for computers to parse the data. Using JSON I created a High Scores system, where a
							players 10 highest scores is saved, this is then written on a .txt file stored locally on the
							computer
							to be displayed on the main menu.

						<h2>What was Learnt</h2>
						<p>
							This was the first game I had developed start to finish using a games engine, and because of this
							it was a major learning experience. Despite having coded for years this was the most creative freedom
							I've had in education, for better and for worse, and due to the solo nature
							of the project I found myself under/overestimating the scope of the project constantly. The greatest lesson I learnt throughout the project was <b>structuring my time</b>. While I had
							plans for the project, I had to learn that each component I wanted to develop would be
							much easier to work with once broken down into smaller segments. The principle of splitting work up has
							been one that I have learnt about for years, but it was here where its practicality finally clicked,
							and I found the project become more like a puzzle to be solved rather than a labyrinth that
							I had to run headfirst into.
							<br><br>
							This was massively aided in communications with peers and mentors because despite the solo
							nature of the project, I would often find that having someone to talk it through with, gave me a deeper understanding of what I was working with before I tackled
							issues, helping me improve on my techniques and skills. Being able to work in a
							space where open communication was encouraged felt <b>rewarding</b> when those conversations led to a successful change.
							<br><br>
							In a technical context, Unity Engine was great to work with. My aim with this project was to
							utilise the engine its full capacity so I could better understand the possibilities. The use of tools such as prefabs, scriptable objects and unity events helped
							me come to terms with the engine. Alongside JSONUtlity, I found that the engine
							directly assisted the development throughout and I hope to  understand other features
							within the engine more in depth as I work on future projects.

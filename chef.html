								<p>Cheffin' it up was a graded assignment in my second semester at the University of
									Staffordshire. The project was my first ventrue into using the Unity Engine,
									featuring a crafting system and points system that is saved locally and compared to
									10 of your other top scores.</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							The goal of this project was to create a 2D Top-Down game with multipictive mechanics,
							providing a full gameplay experince. I really wanted to focus on the mechanics of this
							project,
							and ensure they are not only robust but fun to play around.
							This want lead to me coming to idea of taking inspiration from vampire survivors,
							as the horde survivor genre of games creates opporunity for a playground in where the
							players can freely interact with the mechanics.
							<br><br>
							The focus of the games development went into the<b><i> crafting system</b></i>, <b><i>
									shooting</b></i> and <b><i>high score save system</b></i>.
							Each of these forced me to tackle problem solving outside of what I already knew,
							to not only complete the project but also too create a product I was happy with.

						</div>

						<p>
							The crafting mechanic uses the 'name' variable of the item scriptable objects to check for a
							valid crafting recipe.
							Each recipe contains the three item names used in a matter such as "wheatmeatcheese",
							once the player presses the *cook* button a string search is used (as long as all 3 slots
							are filled)
							to compare the current string of names against the recipe list.
							If a recipe is successfully found the apporiate cooked food scriptable object will be
							created.
							<br><br>
							Originally the crafting system was a simple backdrop to learning how to create an inventory
							system in unity,
							while also having more unique items (current implementation are simple stat changes).
							However, as the focus of the project was to create intiative multipicitve gameplay
							mechanics, as such
							I shifted focus and scope to give the needed time for the main mechanic to be properly
							developed.
							On top of this, I made the decision to simplfy its design, design was gonna feature a
							cooking pot with VFX,
							so that all of the needed information was clear to the player without clutter.
							<br><br>
							The crafting system itself was not all too difficult to implement once I had found my method
							of implementation,
							and made the above design descisions. Where I found the difficulty was the inventory system
							itself.
							Being new to Untiy and having never created a system like this before, I spent alot of time
							iterating the inventory.
							While an inventory itself is as simple as using a List to insert and remove items to/from
							the players inventory,
							the complications arised from attempting to take this system further, namely, the looting
							and drag and drop systems.
							<br><br>
							These issues arised due to poor planning on my behalf, rushing into coding without a plan is
							rule 1 of what not to do,
							and yet I did it none the less. Simple stepping back and looking at the already established
							system.
							I realised that I didn't need to needlessly tack on new systems, I just had to correctly
							utilise my already established
							object-oriented programming fundamentals to use a linked simplified system,
							to hand over references to differnet scripts in a web like manner.
							This system alone taught me so much about proper programming fundamentals, while getting
							first hand experience of the do's and don'ts.
							<br><br>
							The Drag and Drop system utilises the Unity's interfaces:
							<ul>
							IBeginDragHandler<br>
							IDragHandler<br>
							IEndDragHandler
							</ul>
							This helped to simplfy the inventory to crafting systems, as a drag and drop is used in many
							such systems.
							I had issues in where items could not be swapped once added to the inventory,
							as such I created a script utilising the IDropHandler interface to either
							remove the placeholder empty item or to create a temporary reference to the item in the slot
							to
							then replace it with teh selected item before swapping the replaced item into the previous
							slot.

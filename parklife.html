						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							The theming of this project gave me a blank canvas to work with, one which gave me plenty of
							opportunity for exploration into systems I had not managed to grasp in previous projects.
							While the projects have been smaller in scale, I still find it imperative that I <b>push
								myself</b> to learn optimisation techniques within my code. In line with that thought I
							wanted to take another look at C# events and their usage within games.
							<br><br>
							Furthermore, I wanted to experiment with creating unique combat systems for projects, to
							give both players and enemies a different approach to combat than shooting or directly
							running into the player to provide a more unique experience.
						</p>
						<h2>C# Events</h2>

							<p class="image-text" style="position: relative; top: -20px;">From design to implementation
							</p> -->
						</div>
						<p>
							In previous projects I had began to implement C# events, using them to create a robust
							player input controller. From both personal interest and a push from lecturers I decided to
							delve deeper into using them. Previously I had been using references to connect code, what
							while still having its uses within my code, the use of C# events allows for me to decouple
							my code and follow the single dependency, and other such principles better. For this project
							I have used C# events for <b>health related events</b> such as taking damage or dying, this
							script didn’t need to share its functions publicly but could be used to send the needed data
							to any of the <b>“subscribers”</b>, in this case the enemies and player character.
						</p>

							<p class="image-text" style="position: relative; top: -20px;">From design to implementation
							</p> -->
						</div>
						<p>
							The projects central mechanic was the players ability to shove into objects and enemies,
							while the interaction with enemies was quite simple, creating an interact able object took a
							different approach. I used unity’s collision system as a checker, once a player has
							attempted to shove the object a ray cast is sent out in the opposite direction to find a
							piece of the level. Which is then moved towards the found destination, casting a circle cast
							to check for enemies collided with.
							<br><br>
							After having feedback from play testers, I was told while the system was fun it felt like it
							couldn’t be used more than a few times due to objects being stuck, thus I added a ‘bounce’.
							This is where the problems arose, due to the system using world coordinations, reversing the
							coordinates used for the initial movement resulted in the object trying to move to the other
							side of the ‘world-space’. To remedy this I stored where the location the player hit the
							object, before moving it towards that Vector for only a moment to unstick it.
						</p>

						<h2>What was Learnt</h2>
						<p>
							Originally I had conceptilised a different game concept. The game was following the idea of
							'a walk through the park', focusing on the story aspect with the world around the player
							changing, the idea was to have it move through the seasons as you got through the park.
							While an interesting idea, I only had a short time frame to develop this prototype, and the
							idea felt like it would be wasted and lack mechanics if used in prototyping. This shake-up
							of concepts initally sent a wave of disruptions throughout the project, however due to
							employing the use of <b>agile sprints</b>, I took a step back and re-evaluated the scope and
							idea to fit into the smaller development window created by the set backs. Reusing the park
							concept to instead tell a story of saving a park from bug infestion.
							<br><br>
							What this experience taught me was the importance of being able to <b>adapt</b>. Whether
							that be self-evaluted changes, or changes within a team software development is never a
							straight line. The use of sprints allows for the progress of a project to be broken into
							chunks to be evaluted at the start of each iteration. Agile sprints perfectly encapsulate my
							work flow, allowing me to way up the 'weight' of getting whats needed done while still
							leaving room for <b>experimentation and learning</b> where room can be found.

								<p>This project was developed during my studies at University of
									Staffordshire. The goal of this project was to develop and demonstrate a complete
									gameplay experience with Unreal Engine 5, with an emphasis on level and mechanics
									design.</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Over the course of this projects development, I was provided with a crash course on the
							basics of Unreal Engine 5’s capabilities. This gave me a lot of room for
							exploration/experimentation with these systems, and with this I aimed to
							develop an experience that was truly my own.
							The use of blueprinting allowed for rapid iteration on systems, due to the system being
							built for prototyping, allowing for open discussion with peers and mentors on how
							systems could be developed and allowed freedom to make mistakes.
						</p>
						<h2>Gameplay Design</h2>

							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							The design of the game was the major focus of the project, and I used a framework on top of
							<b>iterative prototyping</b>,to ensure a sense of completion with the levels and
							mechanics. I worked alongside peers on ideas and play testing to achieve this which
							was <b>vital</b> to the finished product.
							<br><br>
							A reoccuring critique throughout the development was play testers feeling <b>lost and confused</b>,
							leading to me going back to the drawing board and taking apart my previous
							versions to see where the issue lay. This came down to two main issues: <i>low
								visibility</i> and <i>unintuitive room layouts</i>. Low visibility was due to a mix of
							lighting and prop placement, and one play-tester gave me very detailed feedeback on my use of props
							especially. Sitting down and working through the issue with them helped improve the game
							to the level it is at now with props not just being used as decoration but also to <b>entice the player</b> to the
							next destination. I also added text pop ups when new mechanics were needed to pass
							a new section, as the old gameplay mechanices caused players to think the game had broken.

						<h2>What was Learnt</h2>
						<p>
							This project was a crucial learning step of Unreal Engine 5 with <b>many micro
							discoveries</b> being made throughout, with usage of the tools I understood from level sculpting
							to the niagara system. Outside of Unreal Engine, my major take away from the
							project was how important getting others perspectives and feedback is. Tunnel
							vision of a project is inevitable when working on a single project for a long time, which can lead to 
							a disconnect in <b>designing intuitive systems</b> that any player could understand, and can cause
							a belief that “it’s self explanatory” as you are so familiar with the game. Being exposed to feedback from those
							unfamiliar with the game helped create a smoother process and in curating a better player experience.

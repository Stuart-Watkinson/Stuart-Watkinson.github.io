								<p>This project was developed as a marked assessment in my second term at University of
									Staffordshire. The goal of this project was to develop and demonstrate a complete
									gameplay experience with Unreal Engine 5, with emphasis on the level and mechanics
									design.</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Over the course of this projects development I was provided with a crash course over the
							basics of Unreal Engine 5’s capabilities. This gave a lot of room to spare for
							exploration/experimentation with these systems, with such freedom I aimed throughout to
							develop an experience that was truly my own.
							The use of blueprinting allowed for rapid iteration on systems, due to the system being
							built for prototyping. This allowed for open discussion with peers and mentors on how
							systems could be developed with plenty of room being given for trial and error.
						</p>
						<h2>Gameplay Design</h2>

							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							The design of the game was the major focus of the project, using a framework on top of
							<b>iterative prototyping</b>, making sure there was a sense of completeness with the level and
							mechanics. To achieve this I worked alongside peers on ideas and play testing. This
							communication was <b>vital</b> to the eventual product.
							<br><br>
							A main critique I had throughout the development was play testers feeling <b>lost and confused</b>.
							This often lead me to going back to the drawing board and taking apart my previous
							iterations to see why this could be the case, this came down to two main issues: <i>low
								visibility</i>, and <i>unintuitive room layouts</i>. The low visibility was a mix of
							lighting and prop placement, one play-tester gave me very in-depth thoughts on the props
							especially, sitting down and working through the issue with them helped to bring the level
							to what it is now, props not just being used decoration but also to <b>draw the player</b> to the
							next destination. Alongside this I added text pop ups when new mechanics were needed to get
							past a new section, as I found players thought the game broke or was unbeatable due to the
							mechanics not being intuitive.
						</p>

						<h2>What was Learnt</h2>
						<p>
							This project was a true crash course over Unreal Engine 5 as a whole. There were <b>many micro
							discoveries</b> I made throughout, using all the tools I could understand from level sculpting
							to the niagara system. Though, outside of Unreal Engine itself, my major take away from the
							project as a whole was how important getting others perspectives is. A sense of tunnel
							vision is inevitable when working on a project for a long time, this can lead to a
							disconnect being formed with <b>designing intuitive systems</b> that anyone could understand, and
							believing “it’s self explanatory”. Being able to put my head on straight with some feedback
							helped to stay on track and in scope to create a better experience.
